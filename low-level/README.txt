Note that the low-level API needs to generate the Python interface
to the local FUSE library before it can be used. For that,
you have to have both the FUSE headers and the GCC-XML
(http://www.gccxml.org) compiler installed.

The interface is generated by running 

# python setup.py build_ctypes

this will create the file llfuse/ctypes_api.py

Please keep in mind that it's probably not wise to ship this file
with your application, because it has been generated for your
system only.
